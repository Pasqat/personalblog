# What is this

My personal blog made with **Next.js** and Sanity

## Getting Started

1. create `.env.local` file in root folder with value:

```env
SANITY_PRODUCT_ID=your_datase_name  // from sanity dashboard
SANITY_DATASET_NAME=your_project_id // from sanity dashboard
SANITY_PREVIEW_SECRET=your_secret   // unique string
SANITY_API_TOKEN=your_api_token     // from sanity dashboard
```

2. Run the development server:

```shell
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see
   the result.
